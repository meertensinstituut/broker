#Broker

The broker provides an easy configurable JSON interface translating JSON into Solr requests with support for caching and [query expansion](expansions.html). This enables simple integration of Solr functionality by websites and tools. 

Support for [Mtas](https://textexploration.github.io/mtas/) is integrated in the Broker.

The online search tool with many example queries simplifies the process of testing and development:
